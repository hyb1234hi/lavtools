<h3>Interlace Detection</h3>
<h4>Experimental</h4>
<p>Attempts to perform interlace detection, by FFT
the vertical lines in the screen, and averaging the resulting
frequency spectra.  Also tried experimenting with filtering to
intelligently remove interlace. I have no idea what state this code
is in at the moment.
