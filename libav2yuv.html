<h3>Anything to YUV</h3>
<p>This is a very simple generic anything to yuv tool, using the
libav library from ffmpeg. It supports any video file that libav
supports (which includes WMV3s now!!!) it can be used to replace
the -vo yuv4mpeg option of mplayer or the -f yuv4mpegpipe option
of ffmpeg.  The tool can also override yuv header values, in the
case of incorrect aspect ratio or interlacing etc.  And will perform
simple chroma subsampling conversion, if the source file is not in
the desired chroma subsampling mode.  </p>

<p> I use this regularily for file conversions, so I hope the code
is quite mature, with a thorough set of options and help.  Any bugs
should be picked up quickly.  </p>

<h4>EXAMPLE</h4> <p> <tt> libav2yuv strangefile.avi | y4m-yuvfilter
| ffmpeg -f yuv4mpegpipe -i - -vcodec whatever wantedfile.avi</tt>

<h4>HISTORY</h4> <p> <ul> 

<li>2 Feb 2009. First release of the PCM writer version (use the -w flag)
<li>23 Feb 2008.  Found a bug that would
cause frames to be dropped.  Determined that the AV decode function
is decoding data but not saying the frame is finished.  I have not
been able to find why it is exhibiting this behaviour.  I have
worked around this behaviour by outputting the previous frame when
the frame is not finished.  I am not sure if this causes issues
with non frame based, packet based files (such as mpeg) </li> </ul>
