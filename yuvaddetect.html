<h3>Advertisement detection</h3>
<h4>INCOMPLETE</h4>

<p> Currently only produces a text file (which can be graphed by
gnuplot) of the average lightness of the sourceframes.  The idea
is that there is a black fade before and after advertisements.  To
produce chapter markers for DVDs from TV.</p>

From looking at this above graph it appears that this program is doing a frame difference,
rather than averaging luma. Which is the same function as yuvdiff.

Now we can quite easily see scene changes, shown as sharp spikes. At about 810 and 1500</p>
<p>
We can also tell that the video has gone through a frame rate doubling by
frame dupliation. Shown by the high frequency component.
