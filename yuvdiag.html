<h3>Video Diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Added new operating mode.  Timecode burn.  Will add a timecode stamp to the
video. Also remember to download the <a href="/~mark/lavtools/yuvdiag_font.pbm">font.</a>
</p>
<p> 
This tool has 4 operating modes.
YUV split, which copies the U and V channels into the luma channel.  
Chroma Scope, which shows a histogram of the chroma values in intensity and
Luma Scope, which shows a histogram of luminance on the Y axis.  And a
traditional histogram.
</p>
<p>
This program needs some work to add labels to the histogram scopes, but 
not being a video engineer, I do not know exactly what to add. 
</p>
<p>
feedback would be appreciated.
