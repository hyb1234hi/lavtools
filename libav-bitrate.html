<h3>Bitrate graph producer</h3>
<p>Produces an ASCII file suitable for plotting in gnuplot of the
bitrate per frame.  Also includes a rolling average algorithm that
helps smooth out differences between I frame, P frame and B frames.
Constant bitrate is not so constant.  Requires about 50 frames
rolling average window to get an idea of the average bitrate.</p>

<p> using a post processing tool such as octave to average the graph 
may be useful</p>
