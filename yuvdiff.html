<h3>Frame rate conversion detection</h3>

<p> Started life similar to yuvaddetect, may even contain disused
code from ad detect.  This program produces an ASCII file suitable
for plotting in gnuplot of the difference between consecutive frames
or fields.  Suitable for detecting 3-2 pulldown, or any other
pulldown (frame duplication) frame rate conversion.  If the output
is ran through an FFT it can even detect other frequency rate
changes such as 2.39 (25 to 59.94, progressive PAL to interlaced
NTSC) </p>

<p> This program cannot remove pulldown.  Try my other program
yuvrfps for frame duplication removal.  I do not know of a way to
remove frame blended frame rate conversion.  </p>

<p> I have used this extensively to detect pulldown material.  </p>
