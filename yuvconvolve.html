<h3>Convolution matrix for YUV streams</h3>

<p>Performs a generic convolution filter on the video.  Quite slow.
Support any odd dimension matrix (3x3, 5x5, 7x7...) uses the command
line argument -m 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  </p>

<p> I am thinking about adding support for predefined matricies,
such as blur, sharpen, edge detection, emboss.</P>

<p>I now know that it's not wise to run sharpening on low bitrate
mpeg files, as it highlights the macroblocks.  </p>

<h4>HISTORY</h4>
<ul>

<li> 3 Mar 2008.  Found a bug where the first matrix element was
undefined, which caused the first matrix entry to 0 and sometimes 
caused bus errors. (dont you hate those sometimes bugs...)</li>
</ul>
